Pokemon Management Application
This project is a Pokemon management application with a frontend and backend. The backend provides APIs for managing Pokemon and users, while the frontend interacts with these APIs to display and manipulate data.




Frontend:

URL: https://pokemon-management-app.vercel.app/


https://pokemon-management-app.vercel.app/create-pokemon-user - Create Pokemon Page
https://pokemon-management-app.vercel.app/list-pokemon-users - List Page
https://pokemon-management-app.vercel.app/add-pokemon - Add Pokemon Page

The frontend is developed using ReactJs. It provides a user interface for interacting with Pokemon and user data.

Features :
Home Page: Select a Pokemon owner and view their Pokemon.
Add Pokemon Page: Form to add a new Pokemon and assign it to an owner.
List of Pokemon Users: View all Pokemon users and their Pokemon and we can delete individual user and delete all users.
As per the Assignment documentation every functionality is done like autofilled user and pokemon abilities add button to navigate add pokemon page  and movement of pokemons using  buttons pokemon go to move , pokemon flee to alert , pokemon cease to freeze and etc

Additionally I have added a Navbar which navigates to the corresponding Pages
